## Learning Objectives

* Complete this lab

## Directions

In this lab, you will model a simple household thermometer using a Swift class. It will contain a few properties that you can use to explore the concept of properties as it applies to Swift classes.

The directions for this lab have been written in `Thermometer.playground`, which is distributed with this repository. Open that file to get started. It contains directions on how to complete the lab. The file also includes some tests. When you first open up the playground, these tests will fail, and will be marked as errors. As you complete the tasks in the lab, the errors should disappear. When you have successfully finished the lab, all of the errors will be gone.

Good luck!
