## Learning Objectives

## Outline / Notes

*  This lab should have them create one (maybe two) classes and provide functionality to these classes.
* There should be tests written for this lab. I've included an Xcode project that has started this process so you can see how to see it through (the lab doesn't have to ask them to make a thermometer, I used that as an example).
* Considering I have Pods involved here (for Quick & Nimble testing frameworks), you're required (along with the student) to work in the .xcworkspace file.
* If you wanted to have fun with this one (meaning.. add some visuals or have them do UI stuff as well), you could also test some functions they should be implementing in the ViewController (like I did with the Thermometer).
* You can also save the fun stuff for later as this is the first lab in classes.
